1.	Write a function as part of your LogisticRegression class. This function should receive an index as an input and remove the associated record from the training set. Be sure to pass remove_index function inside the run_model function on a proper location.  You want to be sure that your model will train on the data after removing the datapoint.
2.	Explain why removing data point number 1 and 39 has a large effect on the predicted probability of the model.
3.	Plot the decision boundary by removing data point number 1 and 39.
